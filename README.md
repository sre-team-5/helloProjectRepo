# Line-Coding-Schemes

Line coding schemes are used to translate digital data to digital signals. They are mainly used in physical Layer of OSI model during digital transmission.
Following types of LCS are implemented in this src code:
1. NRZ Unipolar (Non-return to Zero-Unipolar)
2. NRZ-L (NRZ Level Polar)
3. NRZ-I (NRZ Invert Polar)
4. RZ (Return-to-Zero)
5. Manchester
6. Differential Manchester
7. AML (Alternate Mark Inversion)
8. 2B1Q 

These schemes are implemented in the attached file "lineCodingSchemes.py".
I used matplotlib to plot graph of the generated signal. This code has a little issue.
In all schemes, we need to append 1 in list "y" to generate correct pattern of the scheme.

You can take this code and try to update it.
